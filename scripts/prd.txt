# Technical Architecture
## System Components
- **Backend**: Node.js 22.13.0 with Express.js framework
- **Database**: MySQL with Sequelize ORM for data persistence
- **Authentication**: Session-based with express-session
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary for image management and optimization
- **Template Engine**: EJS for server-side rendering
- **Security**: Helmet middleware, rate limiting, CSRF protection

## Data Models
- **User**: Authentication, profile information, roles
- **Exhibition**: Title, description, dates, featured status, curator info
- **Artwork**: Title, description, artist, medium, dimensions, image URLs
- **ExhibitionArtwork**: Many-to-many relationship between exhibitions and artworks

## APIs and Integrations
- RESTful API endpoints documented with Swagger
- Cloudinary API for image upload and transformation
- Session management for authentication state
- Rate limiting for API protection

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Domain-driven design (DDD) architecture
- ECMAScript modules (ESM) throughout
- Environment-based configuration management
- Centralized error handling and logging

# Development Roadmap

- Artwork viewing and navigation
- Responsive design implementation
- Performance optimization

## Phase 6: Advanced Admin Features
- Comprehensive admin dashboard
- User management interface
- Content moderation tools
- Analytics and reporting
- Bulk operations for content management

## Phase 7: Enhanced User Experience
- Advanced search and filtering
- Social sharing capabilities
- Artist profile pages
- Exhibition archives and history
- Mobile app considerations

# Logical Dependency Chain
## Foundation First (Critical Path)
1. Database models and relationships - must be established before any data operations
2. Authentication system - required for any user-specific functionality
3. Basic Express setup with security middleware - foundation for all endpoints

## Quick Visible Progress
4. Simple exhibition listing page - provides immediate visual feedback
5. Basic artwork display - demonstrates core gallery functionality
6. Admin login interface - enables content management workflow

## Building Upon Foundation
7. Exhibition CRUD operations - builds on models and auth
8. Artwork upload system - requires Cloudinary integration and exhibition relationships
9. Public gallery interface - combines all previous components
10. Advanced admin features - enhances existing management capabilities

## Iterative Improvements
- Each phase should result in a working, demonstrable feature
- Features should be atomic but extensible
- Early phases focus on core functionality, later phases on enhancement
- Continuous integration of security and performance considerations

# Risks and Mitigations
## Technical Challenges
- **Cloudinary Integration Complexity**: Start with basic upload, iterate on optimization
- **Session Management Security**: Implement industry-standard practices from the start
- **Database Relationship Complexity**: Design simple, extensible schema initially

## MVP Definition
- **Core MVP**: User auth + basic exhibition listing + artwork display
- **Extended MVP**: Add admin interface and content management
- **Full MVP**: Include search, filtering, and responsive design

## Resource Constraints
- **Development Time**: Prioritize core functionality over advanced features
- **Performance**: Implement caching and optimization incrementally
- **Scalability**: Design for current needs with future expansion in mind
