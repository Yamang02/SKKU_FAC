Reference Directory Structure

Before answering any questions, refer to the directory-structure.md file to ensure responses align with the existing project structure.

Update Directory Structure

If a new file is created or an existing file is modified in a way that changes the project structure, update directory-structure.md accordingly.

Error Handling & Prevention

When fixing an error in a file, review other similar parts of the file that may contain the same type of issue and address them simultaneously.

Clean Architecture Best Practices

Follow Separation of Concerns: Keep business logic, presentation, and infrastructure separate.

Dependency Rule: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

Entities & Use Cases First: The core business logic should be independent of frameworks and external dependencies.

Clear Boundaries: Maintain clear domain boundaries using well-defined interfaces.

Testability: Ensure components are loosely coupled and can be tested independently.

**Do not create files arbitrarily unless I explicitly request file creation via a prompt.

Apply improvements only when I request them and minimize unintended impacts on other aspects of my project.
